# mdbx_benchmark
Source code of the Benchmark tool we use to determine what's the best configuration for MDBX.

Please note that this is the uggliest code you'll ever seen in your life, because I need no more.

You'll need at least 6GB of RAM. A Linux package is already available. For windows/macOS you'll need to compile it yourself.

As said at the end of the benchmark, You can share us the final report on Github, Revolt, Matrix or by email.
